# 0. Big O_ The 'Time Complexity'

For Solving about example, we need to think about 'How can solve more faster with correct answer?'
It can show X-axis is 'Example size' and Y-axis is 'Spend Time'  in XY 2-Dimentional Graph.

Looks like Exponential Function is bad. Because even Example size is small but spend too much time.
Oppositly, Looks like Log Function is good. Because spend not so much time even Big Example Size.

So, we will find Log Function Algorithm.

From this post, we will start learn about Basic Algorithm as Bubble Sort / Selection Sort / Insertion Sort / Quick Sort / Merge Sort
